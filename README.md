ASTA – Informative Article Platform
Project Overview:
ASTA is a web application designed to help researchers and readers access informative articles written by professional or experienced writers who sign up on the platform. The platform enables users to:
•	Read and engage with articles.
•	Comment on posts and react to them.
•	Writers can reply to comments, creating an interactive environment.
Additionally, an admin dashboard will allow platform administrators to manage users, posts, and site settings.
This project also serves as a demonstration of my skills in HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, MySQL, and related tools.

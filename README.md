# ASTA â€“ Informative Article Platform

## Project Overview
ASTA is a web application designed to help researchers and readers access informative articles written by professional or experienced writers who sign up on the platform. The platform enables users to:

- Read and engage with articles.
- Comment on posts and react to them.
- Writers can reply to comments, creating an interactive environment.

Additionally, an admin dashboard allows platform administrators to manage users, posts, and site settings.

This project also serves as a demonstration of my skills in HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, MySQL, and related tools.
